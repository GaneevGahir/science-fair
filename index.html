        <h1><u>What is LiFi</u></h1>
        <p>
            Li-Fi is the transmission of wireless information by using visible light as a channel of communication. It is also known as Light Fidelity. Li-Fi uses subtle fluctuations in LED light to send data from the transmitter to the receiver. It can encode the data, the LED light is replaced on and off at an imperceptible speed generating slight fluctuations that are hidden to the naked eye. These fluctuations create binary codes that are transmitted to the receiver which decodes the information back into digital form.

Li-fi technology is much quicker as compared to traditional Wi-Fi technology. It is able to send data up to 100 Mbps. In some cases, by using parallel transmission, more than 10 Gbps of data can also be sent. This means that you can download high-representation 1080p videos in mere seconds.

Li-Fi is a powerful technology that can change our lives by enabling us to send data from simple LED bulbs that are already being used in most homes and offices. All homes, offices, and different facilities are supplied with lighting.

        <h1><u>History of LiFi</u></h1>
        <p>
            - VLC is an umbrella term that encompasses all communications technologies that use visible light. LiFi makes use of the basic principles of VLC yet uses a two-way network protocol to provide high-speed network connectivity. Much of the research into LiFi was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Edinburgh, spearheaded by Prof. Harald Haas. <br><br>

- Professor Harald Haas and his team of researchers are pioneers in the field of LiFi. They began their research into VLC technology as early as 2006. Much of their research ventured into the use of light as a medium for two-way transmission of data, which paved the way for LiFi technology.<br><br>

- Although it was not the exact moment it was invented, the term LiFi was introduced to the world in 2011 during his TED Talk. The talk was entitled Wireless Data from Every Lightbulb. It was at the talk where he coined the term Light Fidelity (LiFi), a play on the term Wireless Fidelity (WiFi). To demonstrate the capabilities of the new technology, Prof. Haas provided a live demonstration by streaming a large, high-definition video from a standard LED lamp.<br><br>

- Professor Haas helped start a company that would market LiFi technology in 2012. The company was named pureVLC, but was later renamed pureLiFi, and was an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that was set to commercialize LiFi products and push for their integration with existing LED-lighting systems.

- Through the years, pureLiFi was able to produce a variety of LiFi products designed for easy integration of LiFi into existing devices.<br><br>

        <h1><u>Advantages of LiFi</u></h1>
        <p>
            The advantages of Li-fi are as follows : <br><br>

1) It is more protected than Wi-Fi. Wireless communication technologies depend on radio frequency and microwaves are more accessible to eavesdropping, signal hijacking or unauthorized interception, brute force attacks, and spontaneous network connections. <br><br>

2) Li-Fi also has the advantage of being immune from electromagnetic interferences that influence radio-based wireless communication technologies. <br><br>

3) The technology is also beneficial in areas that are electromagnetic sensitive including aircraft cabins, hospitals, and nuclear power plants, among others because it does not generate electromagnetic interference. <br><br>

4) It provides quicker data transfer costs that can advance the famous deployment of the Internet of Things or IoT which needs massive information and effective and efficient connectivity. <br><br>

5) There are various specific foreseeable applications of Li-Fi containing home and building automation. Professionals have also conceptualized traffic applications including the use of street and traffic lights to support data about current road situations, and the headlights and backlights of vehicles to communicate and automate safety measures. <br><br>

        <h1><u>Disadvantages of LiFi</u></h1>
        <p>
            The disadvantages of lifi are as follows : <br><br>

1) The main disadvantage of lifi is that the light cannot move through objects, hence if there is some object or any wall in between sender and receiver the signal will divide at once. <br><br>

2) Interference from external sources of light like sunlight, bulbs, and opaque materials will generate disturbance in the transmission of light. <br><br>

3) Wifi and radiofrequency will be required in the remote areas where trees and walls will facilitate as an obstacle. <br><br>

    <section class="works" id="works">
        <h1><u>How LiFi works</u></h1>
        <p>
            - A LiFi network uses the light from LED lamps to send data to a device, such as a laptop or tablet. The device has a receiver to pick up light signals and a transmitter to send light signals back to the lamp using infrared light. <br><br>

            - The light from the LED lamps changes intensity billions of times a second, faster than the eye can see. This change in intensity becomes a digital signal which can carry information from the internet to a user and back again. <br><br>
             
            - Multiple lights can be added to a single network, so that you can move around from light to light without losing your connection. You don't have to be directly under a lamp to use LiFi. The digital signal is also carried by light reflected off walls and other surfaces. <br><br>
            
            - A LiFi network still needs a regular internet service provider to supply internet to a home or office via wires. LiFi can then be deployed within a home or office to provide a wireless internet connection to devices. <br><br>

            <p>
                Many experts foresee a movement towards Li-Fi in homes because it has the potential for faster speeds and its security benefits with how the technology works. Because the light sends the data, the network can be contained in a single physical room or building reducing the possibility of a remote network attack. Though this has more implications in enterprise and other sectors, home usage may be pushed forward with the rise of home automation that requires large volumes of data to be transferred through the local network.

            <p>
                Most remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) are controlled by wired connections. The length of their cabling places a hard limit on their operational range, and other potential factors such as the cable's weight and fragility may be restrictive. Since light can travel through water, Li-Fi based communications could offer much greater mobility. Li-Fi's utility is limited by the distance light can penetrate water. Significant amounts of light do not penetrate further than 200 meters. Past 1000 meters, no light penetrates.

            Increasingly, medical facilities are using remote examinations and even procedures. Li-Fi systems could offer a better system to transmit low latency, high volume data across networks. Besides providing a higher speed, light waves also have reduced effects on medical instruments.

                Anywhere in industrial areas data has to be transmitted, Li-Fi is capable of replacing slip rings, sliding contacts, and short cables, such as Industrial Ethernet. Due to the real-time of Li-Fi (which is often required for automation processes), it is also an alternative to common industrial Wireless LAN standards. Fraunhofer IPMS, a research organization in Germany states that they have developed a component which is very appropriate for industrial applications with time-sensitive data transmission.
